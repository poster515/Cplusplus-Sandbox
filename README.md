# Cplusplus-Sandbox
Repo with random, mini C++ projects.

Check out DSP_test for some examples using function templates, class templates, digital signal processing, multithreaded processing.

Check out Connect Four to play a game of connect four via the command line. Very invigorating. 

All other projects attempt to utilize functionality akin to their title (e.g., "Pointers").
